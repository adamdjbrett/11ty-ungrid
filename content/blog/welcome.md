Welcome to the Ungrid Blog! This is the first post on our new platform built with 11ty and ungrid.css.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog demonstrates how to build a modern static site with minimal dependencies and maximum performance. We focus on:

- Clean, readable content
- Fast page loads
- Responsive design without bloat
- Easy maintenance and deployment

## The Tech Stack

We're using:

1. **11ty (Eleventy)** - A flexible static site generator
2. **ungrid.css** - A 54-byte responsive grid system
3. **Markdown** - For easy content creation
4. **Nunjucks** - For templating

## Getting Started

To create your own Ungrid blog, clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8080`.
