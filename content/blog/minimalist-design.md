Minimalist design isn't about having nothing. It's about having only what matters.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity

Every element on the page should serve a purpose. If it doesn't help the reader understand your message, remove it.

### 2. Performance

Minimalist sites load faster because they have less to load. This benefits all users, especially those on slow connections.

### 3. Accessibility

With fewer elements and simpler code, minimalist sites are often more accessible to people using assistive technologies.

### 4. Maintainability

Less code means fewer bugs, easier updates, and simpler deployments.

## In Practice

This blog exemplifies these principles:

- No tracking scripts
- No ads or pop-ups
- No heavy frameworks
- Pure semantic HTML
- Minimal CSS (54 bytes!)

## The Cost of Bloat

The average website today weighs more than 4MB. That's larger than the entire first version of the web. Every kilobyte matters, especially on mobile networks.

By embracing minimalism, we can:
- Reduce bandwidth usage
- Lower server costs
- Improve user experience
- Make the web more inclusive

## Conclusion

Minimalism isn't a limitation—it's a discipline that forces us to be intentional about every choice we make.
